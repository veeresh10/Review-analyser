The main motive behind developing Review analyser is to help online buyers make
promising decisions by choosing the right product based on the existing customer reviews.
e emergence of online shopping platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, E-bay has enabled
people to purchase products from the comfort of their place and express their opinions
about the product. ese opinions are basically termed as reviews. On such platforms,
large amounts of data[reviews] are produced. ese reviews will help the potential buyers
to make a decision and also provides an opportunity for companies to assess the people’s
opinions towards their product. But wouldn’t the buyer be confused after reading 100’s
of the different types of reviews on the same product. is is where the Review analyser
comes into the picture.

used in this project are online product reviews collected from various E-commerce sites.
