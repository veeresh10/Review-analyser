  I got the wire to charge my iphone after being disappointed by so may others out there.. this one proved to be great! The 3 different charging extension helps me charge my phone and the power bank in one go and is overall very efficient. I just carry around this one charging wire for all my electronic needs! The wire charges fast and is a great asset for me

  It's a very good multi charging cable. Don't know if it's a fast charging cable but it charges fast if used with single device at a time.I definitely recommend this product.

  I have 3 phones , 1 Has lightning port, 1 Has type C , 1 Has micro usb.This thing is really helpful to me as I have only 2 sockets in my hostel room and borrowing an extension from my friends isn’t always good. So this is the thing for me. Overall I think the packaging could have been better rest everything is fine.Update : It stopped working.

  We cool nylon 3 in 1 cable is too good.  You can charge multiple devices at the same time. It charges very fast. And the headache of carrying multiple chargers with you when you are travelling is also solved as you you can charge your iPhone or any android phone with this. At this price it offers very good value for money

  It doesn't support Data. It is only charging cable. Didn't expect WeCool can provide wrong information....

  I have a lot of devices. And iPad Pro 11, iPhone 11 Pro and android phones so carrying different chargers for every phone is a real hassle. So I ordered this cable. I have tried It with all of my devices and it is working fine with all devices with different ports type. However when I tried charging three devices of different port types together, charging speed was too slow so I charged one device at one time and then it is working fine.

  I use this cable to charge 3 kind of device one at a time, cable help to charge device but it failed after 30days of using it. This cable dose not support data transfer for any kind of devicefrom outside quality looks good but internal connection with jack is fragileThere is warranty you can't claim as there is a underlining to register this cable in before 15 days of purchase.

  I got cheated. I did not check the country of Origin and bought a Made In China product. I have stopped buying products made in that country since Made in India movement emphasis. This is another defective product. The prong for the Apple I Phone does not work at all. I tried with three different I phones 5S that I have and this did not work with any of those. It worked only on OppO phone. I paid for three prongs while only one works.  Be careful if you buy this one....... The cover sleeve from the I Phone charging prong came off within the first 5 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That speaks for the Quality!!!!!!!!!!

"

  The product looks classy and compact. Cable that arrived was faulty. It works only if charging device is placed at specific angles. Got replacement but the new cable charges slow even with a single device. When you connect multiple devices simultaneously the adapter heats up and charges slow. This cable took 6 hours to charge a single device with 3000 mAh battery. The type C cable is a one side cable, it doesn't charge when connected with the blank side on top. Want to return it but they just have 10 days replacement option. Do not recommend it.

"

  Liked this 3 in 1 concept to save some money instead of buying multiple cables but finally incurred loss. I purchased this cable few weeks back. It says fast charging, but it's charging speed is less than normal speed. Not even able to charge 10% in an hour. I have used it hardly for 15 days. Waste of money.

"

  Very cheap quality product..didn’t last even for a week...I seriously thought it’ll be a great product as I can charge all my phone in 1 go but it really turned out to be a very cheap product.. yesterday while I was pull out the I phone jack from my phone , I was surprised to see the charging pin was broken & was stuck in my I phone charging point.. very disappointed with the quality of the product..not gonna buy any lead from Amazon in future , God knows if they are of same quality 😡😡😡😡

"

  The cable cannot be used in the car with Android Auo or Apple Car play. Buy only if you want to charge your devices and not have any data transfer over it.Unfortunately Amazon doesn’t let me return this even though it is not useful for me.

  There doesn’t seem to be enough charging power travelling through this chord as It says it charges all three at the same time, i say the lightning cable doesn’t work at all!! I have tried in both of my iphones and it simply doesn’t charge!! Only micro usb cable works

"
27,"

  This cable is quite bad on all levels.It's USB-C  connector stopped charging within a few months of purchase. It cannot charge 2 or more devices simultaneously either. Braided cable is ok, but plastic covers on connectors broke off within 2-3 days of use. It is being sold for Rs 350, but the overall quality is same as cables sold for Rs 150 in roadside stalls.I had taken it on a long trip and had to buy new cables because it stopped working. Typical chinese low quality stuff.

"

  The only thing fast about this order was the delivery, which reached me within 3 hours from ordering. The cable does not support fast charging. It's slower than regular charging without the dash adapter. False advertising.Cannot comment about the durability or strength yet. But expecting to be fully disappointed on those counts too.

"
29,"

  The delivery package came in a small plastic bag, it looked strudy but with in two days the wire fixtures coming off . They seem to be just stuck around with bad glue . The wire parts around the charging point and usb point all have come off. Dont purchase , not worth the money.Not at all fast charging.

  Does not support fast charging for my Samsung device.No point of buying...hence I am returning my product

"
31,"

  I purchased it for triple use with my OnePlus Nord (Type C USB), older Samsung Galaxy 7 (Micro USB and iPad.I found that the Type C pin is a little over-sized and would not connect. I tried it with another Samsung phone with Type C port and there also it would not connect.Obviously I did not use excesssive force to avoid damaage to the bult in female portion in the phone.  ( I have other Type C connectors and they  are mating smoothly). Howerver, other pins viz., microUSB and iP pins are OK. The nylon braiding and look are all fine.In short it didnt serve the purpose for which I bought it. Looks like there was no quality control or  it is a reject . Dont buy it if you are looking for use with Type C port device.

"

  The cable wire is a 2nd replacement, however is not compatible for Iphone 6s Plus as against mentioned is the brief description of the product.We are obligated to either thrash away the cable wire or keep replacing it since it does not work even on MI Note 7 phone.  As a customer we don't have time to keep replacing things, should be accurate in the first go.

"

  Amazon should take it updating the product description.This cable doesn't support fast charging.Cable durability and quality wise is good. But Its normal charging wire. Even data transfer is also not that fast.

  1. The packet itself has no WeCool brand on it but just a sticker on it has the brand name ""WeCool"". It makes the product itself prone to be replaced with fake ones. Anyone can duplicate it with a fake sticker. So I clearly doubt the originality of the product in itself. The company should have given a box and sealed it with plastic wrap like the most genuine brand does.2. My Moto X4 phone charges normally in 45 minutes with a turbocharger, but using this cable plugged into the same Moto turbocharger takes appx 2 hours to charge it ( also if only 1 device is being charged ). In that way, I cannot say it's a Type C cable in itself. It adds more time to completely charge when 2 devices are plugged.3. To my expectations, the cable can save you when you need your drained-up phone in a while but not immediately.4. I hope our companies make better and efficient products and apply fair pricing, so they could compete in the global market.

"

  It’s a nice cable and charges the phones. However as claimed in its photos that it can be used in cars etc, is not true. It does charge, but it does not sync with Apple CarPlay or any other syncing is not possible.

"
36,"

  The wire works as specified — I am able to connect USB C, micro USB and iPhone for charging.The charging speed is definitely high - even on slow charging adapters. The only drawback is that it does not function as a data cable. The PC does not pick up the connection when phone is connected, but it does charge well on PC USB as well. Maybe that's the give and take for such a design.I am also able to connect devices simultaneously for charging and it does charge simultaneously. Durably designed. It is sturdy.

  I am reviewing this item after using it for more than a month and I used it for my son's iPhone 6+ and it's working fine...

  It was good at the start. However it started to malfunction in 3 months. Stopped charging consistently. No information on the invoice on how to get a warranty replacement. No reply from the seller either. Their one year warranty seems a farce.

  I bought this to facilitate simultaneous charging for Android, Apple and the new Samsung phones. Within a month the Android charger pin heads are sunk deep meaning they have lost their tension and are unable to make contact and the charger head slips out. This is bad but the other two are okay so far,

"

  I request with folded hand please don’t buy this . I worked so much research before buying it, so many people refused me that don’t buy wecool cable but didn’t go with them and bought it on 6 oct. 2020. It’s 20th oct 2020 today and my cable is not functioning now and m so much disappointed to choose this. Poorest and very cheat class product, no service, to warranty, nobody listen your complaint. Go for any other brand but don’t buy wecool.

  The cable seems to be ok for charging but doesn't work with Android Auto Car. Requested a replacement - let's see...19th Feb 2021 - got a replacement part. Turns out it is a wrong product :-) Requested Amazon to just cancel the order. There is no communication of any kind from the vendor.

  I'm disappointed to see the unbranded packet it came in and thought it to be a thick cable. It doesn't support Android Auto (means data is not supported). It is nylon braided and genuine product, so hoping to see it last long

  Horrible. This is the second time I am ordering this product as it was convenient. The first time, all 3 pins charged but the product wasn't sturdy and one of the pins broke.  So I reordered. In the new product, one of the pins for charging iPhone doesn't work at all. It's a faulty product.

"

  Worst item I have ever bought from Amazon.  Not at all fit for charging 3 phone together. Forget three phone, not even 1 phone does charge well. I will never suggest anyone to buy this. Loosly connect from charger end, usb not perfectly fit with charger body, whereas, original charger or another good brad extended braided cable I have, they all function well with same charger plug. Totally disappointed.

  Quality of the product is very good and nice and flexible to carry and charging is happening quickly if you putbinto power bank. Simply superb worth buying. Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery atbthis situation.

  Only product quality is good... But its not fast charging compatible. Its dummy ... Wont support 3A, It gives just 2A power...All think we can charge 3 mobiles at a time. But trust me Instead charging 3 mobiles at a time, we can charge them individually with another normal wire in less time than this cable take.Worst part is Amazon with out validating product, promoting cheaper products..

  This is really a very nice cable. It is tough, good quality and does fast charging at the same time.
